The project focuses on transforming urban transportation systems by introducing a smart traffic signal control structure that uses image processing and machine learning. Real-time images taken by traffic cameras undergo continuous processing using the open CV platform. The YOLOv8n algorithm is supported to not only detect but also calculate the density of traffic lanes, permitting active alterations to traffic signals based on real-time conditions. This highly developed technique outshines optimization; it places a strong emphasis on safety and the ability to react quickly. By including characteristics that emphasize emergency vehicles, this suggested system ensures a swift and productive response to critical situations, saving lives. Additionally, the dedication to safer pedestrian crossings reflects a holistic approach to traffic management, identifying the various needs of urban environments. By aiding adaptability through image processing and machine learning, the smart traffic control system aims to provide a safer, more systematic, and more sustainable urban transportation infrastructure. Through its inventive features, this project marks an essential vault forward in dealing with the challenges connected with urban mobility, promising a future where transportation is perfectly integrated while prioritizing safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
